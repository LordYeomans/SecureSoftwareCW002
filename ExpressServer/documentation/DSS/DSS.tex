\section{Privacy and ethics}
Privacy and ethics are essential for secure web development as they protect user data, foster trust, mitigate risks, ensure legal compliance, and enhance the overall user experience. By prioritizing privacy and code of ethics, developers contribute to a safer and more responsible digital environment.
\subsection{Data Protection}
Privacy is essential to safeguard user data. Web developers must compliance with Privacy Laws and code of ethics to protect personal information collected through websites. Such as implementing encryption, secure data storage and access controls to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
\subsection{User Trust}
Respecting user privacy and code of ethics can build trust between users and websites. Users are more likely to share personal information and make transactions when they trust the website. Secure web development could encourage users to have stronger relationships with the website.
\subsection{Ethical Data Handling}
Developers have responsibility to handle user data ethically. They should state out the purpose and range of data collection, get users' agreement and only use data for its intended purpose. Ethical considerations also include ensuring transparency in data practices, providing users with control over their data, and minimizing the collection of personally identifiable information whenever possible.
\subsection{Mitigating Risks}
Privacy and ethics help in mitigating various risks associated with web development. By implementing secure functions, developers can mitigate cyber threats such as data breaches, identity theft and unauthorized access. 
\subsection{User Experience}
Privacy and ethics can improve user experience. Respecting user privacy preferences and providing transparent data  brings a better user experience and builds up a positive relationships between users and websites.

\section{Mitigations}

\subsection{SQL Injection}
%What was coded
%Usability
%Any prebuilt libraries
SQL Injection is when SQL code is ran on a website via a textbox or entry field. The way we have mitigated this is by using parametrised queries wherever the user inputs data for a query. A parametrised query is a query that "drops in" the variables instead of using string concatenation. Because the values are not added on the end and are instead dropped in, the user has no way of terminating the query to run their own code. We used the node library "pg" to communicate with the database, this library had built in support for parametrised queries so no other library was needed. These queries function the same as normal queries and run at similar speeds to normal ones meaning the user wont notice the difference. As this is all happening server side it will have no direct impact on usability, however if these queries were to run slow then the user would notice.
\subsection{Account Enumeration}
%What was coded
%Usability
%Any prebuilt libraries
Account Enumeration is when a user iterates through a dictionary of possible username and uses the response from the server to determine if that username is in use or not. The way we have prevented this is by making the response from the server the same whether the username or the password is incorrect making it hard to tell which one if any were correct. We have also made the timing of the responses the same so that they can not be told apart that way, this was done by running through the entire login process no matter whether the username or password was correct. This can have an impact on usability as it can make the process of forgetting login information slower and less informative, if you forget your credentials the website wont tell you which of them you got right which can be frustrating for users.
\subsection{Cross-site Scripting}
Cross-site Scripting is when code is injected into a website to then be executed later, this typically happens in the form of html and JavaScript code that gets issued to a text form to run when its displayed later. The way we have mitigated this is through html encoding, all of the html characters ($<$,$>$,",\,\&) needed to write code have special characters that represent them so websites can display them safely, we use this when displaying posts as its the only time code could be injected to run later. Before the posts are displayed on the screen they all go through a function that converts html characters to their display counterparts so $<$ becomes \&lt while being ran but will display as $<$. This should have little to no affect on usability as the users wont see the converted characters and the process is very fast so it should not be much slower than if we didn't do it.
\subsection{Cross-site Request Forgery}
Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other. The way we mitigate this is using CSRF token. A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When issuing a request to perform a sensitive action, such as creating a post, the client must include the correct CSRF token. Otherwise, the server will refuse to perform the requested action. CSRF tokens help protect against CSRF attacks by making it difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim. As the attacker has no way of predicting the correct value for the CSRF token, they won't be able to include it in the malicious request.
\subsection{Session Hijacking}
Session hijacking is as the term suggests. A user in a session can be hijacked by an attacker and lose control of the session altogether, where their personal data can easily be stolen. After a user starts a session such as logging into a banking website, an attacker can hijack it. In order to hijack a session, the attacker needs to have substantial knowledge of the user’s cookie session.

We used two methods to mitigate session hijacking. We used HTTPS to ensures that there is SSL/TLS encryption throughout the session traffic. Attackers will be unable to intercept the plaintext session ID, even if the victim’s traffic was monitored. We also used session keys for our website. This renders the session ID extracted by attackers useless as the ID changes immediately after authentication. 
\section{Authentication methods}	
The main aim of authentication methods, are to increase the security of a website however this can come at a price, usually increasing the time it takes for users to login. Two-Factor Authentication along with a password are the two most common forms of authentication methods and can be seen on most modern websites. Two-Factor Authentication requires users to enter a “One-time password (OTP)” from another device, such as a mobile device, into the website they’re attempting to verify themselves to.
\subsection{Passwords}
In order to increase security of the website, authentication methods were needed. The most common form of authentication is the use of a password being assigned to each username when users created their account. Despite passwords increasing security, a study by Google in 2019 concluded that “52\% reuse the same password for multiple (but not all) accounts.” \cite{OnlineSurvey} This study showed how poor the general public are at ensuring their accounts are safe and therefore multiple authentication methods are needed. Therefore, another authentication method would be needed to further increase security.
\subsection{Two-Factor Authentication}
The other authentication method that was created and coded was the use of “Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)”. During account registration, users need to download an application onto their mobile device. The application known as “Google Authenticator” randomly generates a 6-digit code every 30 seconds which the user needs to enter correctly before their account is successfully created. When users are logging in, they will also be prompted to enter their code into the website. Despite this increasing the time taken to login, “80\% of security breaches can be prevented with 2FA” \cite{2FAStatisitics} and so this small increase in time is beneficial in increasing security.
 	
\section{Testing}
\subsection{Think Aloud Testing}
Think aloud testing is when users are handed the product, in this case the website, and asked to perform a series of tasks, they are monitored during this and their progress is recorded along with any issues they encounter. This type of testing is for usability and is typically performed in 3 or more rounds, you would record the results of people in different demographics and using the notes make improvements, after the improvements a new group of people from the same demographics would use the site.

The tasks the users where asked to perform where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Register an account
	\item Make a post
	\item Log out
	\item Log in
	\item View the post you made
	\item View all available posts
\end{itemize}
These tasks where performed in the order listed and allowed us to test all aspects of our site individually. We tested on 3 different demographics, young male university students, young female sixform students and female adults. 

The young male managed to create an account with ease and make a post, however he noted that the website gives a lack of information on whether the post was successfully made or not causing this task to take longer than expected. He had no problems logging out and then back in, he tried to search for the category his post was under however our search bar only works based off of title so it didn't work. To view all posts he simple pressed buttons on the screen around the search bar and happened to press the search button while the bar was empty which shows every post. Overall he did not find it easy to use due the lack of feedback the site gives on whether actions are successful or not. The table of results for this test can be found in Figure \ref{YMale}.

The young female did not like the 2 factor authentication used as it required a new app on their phone. She had no issues until tasked with viewing all posts, after a couple of minutes of looking they gave up. The table of results for this can be found in Figure\ref{YFemale}.

The adult female had the same issues as the young male, they didn't know if the test was successfully made and they did not easily find the way to search for all posts. The table of results can be found in Figure\ref{Female}.
\subsection{Unit Testing}
This website was thoroughly tested using unit tests, these tests where carried out throughout development and also at the end. The final test results can be found in figure\ref{Testing} and it shows that all but 2 test were passed. The two tests that did not pass are failing two factor authentication (test 30) and Searching for something that does not exist (test 32). In both cases the behaviour demonstrated is valid however the user is not informed. If you get the two factor authentication code wrong at log in or registration it does not tell the user this but it does not log the user in either. If the user searches for a title that has no results, the user is not told that nothing could be found but nothing is displayed either.
